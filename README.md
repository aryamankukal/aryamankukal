## Hi there, I'm Aryaman! 👋

I'm a Data Science and Computer Science student at UC Berkeley, passionate about building useful and scalable AI systems—especially at the intersection of NLP, ML infra, and agentic AI. Whether it’s building robust backends or shipping LLM-powered tools from idea to MVP, I thrive on solving real-world problems with clean, creative engineering.

### 🧠 About Me

- 🛠️ **Currently working on**: Scholara.ai – building an LLM-based platform to simplify dense academic research papers via semantic search, citation-aware knowledge graphs, and voice-based agents.
- 📚 **Learning**: Applied ML infra, LLM deployment, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) using vector DBs like Chroma and FAISS.
- 🤝 **Open to Collaborate**: Always down to contribute to fast-paced teams or research projects that involve ML, NLP, or GenAI workflows—especially early-stage tools with impact potential.
- 💬 **Ask me about**: LLMs, AI agents, semantic search, scalable backend systems, or anything at the intersection of ML and usability.
- ⚡ **Fun Fact**: I’ve led teams across hackathons like CalHacks and TreeHacks, and built award-winning tools like AudioLec and ChatGuard.
