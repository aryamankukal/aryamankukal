### 🧠 About Me

- 🛠️ **Currently working on**: Building agent-based AI systems for document understanding and automation using LLMs, vector DBs, and retrieval pipelines.
- 📚 **Learning**: Deep diving into Generative AI and applied NLP—especially vector search, fine-tuning, and agent orchestration.
- 🤝 **Open to Collaborate**: Looking to contribute to innovative research/startups in AI, NLP, or ML infra—especially where I can design backend systems or ML-driven workflows.
- 💬 **Ask me about**: AI agents, ML infrastructure, vector databases, open-source NLP tools, or how to build fast MVPs for LLM applications.
- ⚡ **Fun Fact**: I've led and competed in several hackathons—including CalHacks and TreeHacks—and co-developed tools like ChatGuard and AudioLec!
