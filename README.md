## Hi there, I'm Aryaman! 👋

I'm a student studying Data Science and Computer Science at UC Berkeley.

I'm currently at Medoh building high‑performance search and personalization systems to digitize and scale the doctor–patient experience.

I'm interested in applied NLP, LLM infrastructure, and clever, intuitive interfaces.

You can find my previous experience on Linkedin and my work on Github.

Reach out at aryamankukal [at] berkeley [dot] edu.

When I'm not building, you'll find me with my dog Astro, trying an ethnic food spot, writing, at a concert, in the gym, or on a late‑night drive blasting R&B.

### 🧠 About Me  

- 🛠️ **Currently working on**:  
  - **Medoh Health** → Building an LLM-powered semantic search system (embeddings, pgvector, caching, personalization)  
  - **FHL Vive Center @ UC Berkeley** → Research assistant on TAI Team, developing an LLM-powered educational agent for Berkeley courses (RAG + orchestration)  
  - **Dhisana AI** → Contributing to GTM agent infrastructure as an open-source developer (Dockerized workflows, LangChain/LangGraph)  
  - **LeetReps** → Chrome extension that applies **spaced repetition** to LeetCode problems — tracks solved questions and auto-schedules reviews to boost retention  

- 📚 **Learning**: Semantic search, LLM optimization, vector DBs (FAISS/Chroma), LangChain, and agent orchestration
- 🤝 **Open to Collaborate**: Looking to contribute to startups or research in NLP, GenAI infra, or agentic systems
- 💬 **Ask me about**: LLMs, backend infra, hackathon strategy, vector search, open-source tools
- ⚡ **Fun Fact**: I love singing (amateur R&B enthusiast), vibing to music, and editing videos — back in the day, I ran a YouTube channel with skits, short films, and trickshot videos.

### 👶 Where It All Started

Before building LLM agents and scaling ML infra, I was just a kid experimenting with Python on my family laptop. Some of the first programs I ever wrote (ages 10–12):

- 🕰️ [**Live Virtual Analog Clock**](https://github.com/aryamankukal/My-Python-Programs/blob/master/Live%20Virtual%20Analog%20Clock)  
  A real-time analog clock built with Python’s turtle and datetime, featuring synced hands, smooth animations, and custom-drawn visuals—no external libraries used.

- 🧮 [**Calco**](https://github.com/aryamankukal/My-Python-Programs/blob/master/Calco:%20A%20Python%20Programmed%20Mathematician)  
  A voice-controlled calculator built with Python that listens to spoken math problems using speech_recognition, parses the input, performs the operation, and speaks the answer aloud

- 🎥 [**Cinema Movie Program**](https://github.com/aryamankukal/My-Python-Programs/blob/master/CinemaMovieProgram.py)  
  A simple yet functional movie ticketing system with age restrictions, real-time seat tracking, and user interaction, all built with basic Python logic.
