## Hi there, I'm Aryaman! 👋

I'm a Data Science and Computer Science student at UC Berkeley, passionate about building impactful and scalable AI systems—especially at the intersection of NLP, LLM infra, and agentic workflows. I love turning technical ideas into polished tools that solve real-world problems.

### 🧠 About Me

- 🛠️ **Currently working on**:
  - Studying RAG, AI agents, and open-source LLM pipelines
  - Contributing to GTM agent infrastructure at [Dhisana AI](https://github.com/dhisana-ai) as an open-source developer
  - Building a Chrome extension that applies **spaced repetition** to LeetCode problems — tracks solved questions and auto-schedules smart reviews to boost long-term retention and performance

- 📚 **Learning**: Semantic search, LLM optimization, vector DBs (FAISS/Chroma), LangChain, and agent orchestration
- 🤝 **Open to Collaborate**: Looking to contribute to startups or research in NLP, GenAI infra, or agentic systems
- 💬 **Ask me about**: LLMs, backend infra, hackathon strategy, vector search, open-source tools
- ⚡ **Fun Fact**: I’ve built award-winning AI tools like AudioLec and ChatGuard, and co-led teams at CalHacks, TreeHacks, and TSA Nationals

### 👶 Where It All Started

Some of my earliest coding experiments from age 10–12:

- 🕰️ [**Live Virtual Analog Clock**](https://github.com/aryamankukal/My-Python-Programs/blob/master/Live%20Virtual%20Analog%20Clock)  
  A real-time analog clock built with `turtle`, complete with animated hands and a golden dial.

- 🧮 [**Calco**](https://github.com/aryamankukal/My-Python-Programs/blob/master/Calco:%20A%20Python%20Programmed%20Mathematician)  
  A talking calculator that takes voice input and speaks the answer back.

- 🎥 [**Cinema Movie Program**](https://github.com/aryamankukal/My-Python-Programs/blob/master/CinemaMovieProgram.py)  
  A mini movie ticketing system with age checks and seat tracking.
